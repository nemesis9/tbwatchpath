tbwatch:  watch filesystem paths and report on events in Linux

intended use model:  to log accesses to directories and files that are not expected to be accessed and/or modified.
                     The default code base reports a few important accesses, but this can be tailored by modifying
                     the list of events in a configuration file.
                     You may not want to watch frequently accessed directories such as /tmp or your log 
                     will fill up fast!  Or, you can cut down on the events reported.

run model:  runs as a systemd service.

requirements: Linux kernel version 2.6.13 or greater for inotify
              C++11 compiler
              Linux OS with systemd active 
              systemd service file (included)

usage:  needs a input configuration file specified on the command line (-c) option or a file named tbwatchpath.cfg
        in the /etc/ directory.
        This configuration specifies the paths to watch and the events to watch.

        For instance:
        Example watchpaths.cfg

            #EXAMPLE CONFIG          
            #comments will be ignored          

            #default notification is IN_CREATE | IN_DELETE | IN_MODIFY
            watch=/watched_dir

            #specific notification types can be given like so:
            watch=/other_watched_dir:IN_OPEN:IN_DELETE
            #END EXAMPLE CONFIG

        It recognizes the keys: watch

        tbwatch -h    - provides basic usage
        tbwatch -doc  - provides more detailed help 

        #EVENTS
        events are logged to the syslog (e.g. /var/log/syslog)
        events are tagged with tbwatch (e.g. cat /var/log/syslog | grep tbwatch)

building: there is a default service file and a default configuration 
          edit these to your liking
          
          In the Makefile directory

          make
          sudo make install
          sudo make uninstall

          (edit paths in Makefile to suit your system)

notes:  requires systemd, this means you if you're running on Ubuntu, you will need 15.04
        check your system
